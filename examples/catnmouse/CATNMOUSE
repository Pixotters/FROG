= Cat and mouse game =

Basic game meant to guide us determining the order of importance between 
modules to implements. It will start with a very basic application and will be 
improved over iterations.

== Synopsis ==

Cat must catch Mouse.

== First iteration ==

=== Game scenario ===

  # Player launches the game
  # Window appears and render the scene
    -- Black lines represent walls
    -- A blue circle represents the cat, a red one represents the mouse
  # Player plays (until he wins)
    -- Player uses arrows to move the cat
    -- Mouse moves using random direction
    -- Mouse can not go through walls, cat neither
    -- When the blue circle touches the red one, player wins

=== Modules to implement ===

To produce this game we need to:

  - Open a window
  - Render a simple scene
    -- one panel
    -- simple shapes
       --- circle
       --- line (actually rectangle)
  - Handle input
    -- queue inputs
    -- Game loop
       --- react to inputs (during game loop)
           ---- poll inputs
           ---- process inputs
       --- compute new situation
           ---- move entities
           ---- detect collision
       --- render the new situation

Summary:
  - Window
  - Renderer
  - Inputs (keyboard)
  - Game loop
  - Collision
