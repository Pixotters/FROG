= Collision manager =

The Collision Manager is a module that will detect collisions (and also 
separation) of two bodies. Once a collision / separation detected, the 
manager will use a callback function you set during initialization.

NB: the ``LSAP`` module from frog library uses double-linked lists, so 
explanations will focus on this implementation, but you should be aware of 
the fact that implementation using arrays could have better performances, 
but this is not our point here.
