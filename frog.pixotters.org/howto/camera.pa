= How to control the camera = 

The **Renderer** holds a camera. This is simply a //sf::View//, so we invite 
you to read the documentation of SFML to learn more.  
You can perform each operation of //sf::View//, the only thing you have to do 
is to call the method //updateCamera// of the **Renderer**
```
renderer.camera.move(30.5, 100.2);
renderer.camera.zoom(1.10f);
renderer.camera.rotate(45);
renderer.updateCamera();
```
