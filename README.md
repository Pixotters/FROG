# FROG Project - Nicolas Cailloux & Julien Sagot

For Really Outstanding Games, a C++ framework for game development.  
FROG is **free**, open-source, and **easy to use**. 

## Overview

- Abstract and modular: FROG is generic enough to be used in as many games 
genre as possible. It is provided in separated modules, users can choose 
features they need. 
- Game loop (scenario): handling the general process of computing and 
rendering among different scenes, considering the frame lag.
- Resources: smart assets managment, avoiding to load the same file twice. 
- Easy inputs: FROG supports keyboard, mouse and up to 8 joysticks. You can 
define buttons and actions very easily. 
- Rendering: sprites, text, animations, are simple to define.
- Physics: a simple physic engine is provided, allowing to apply forces. In 
case you don't need powerful physics. 
- Collision: famous algorithm *Sweep And Prune* is provided as collision 
detection handler. 

## Coming soon 

- Tile maps (format **Tiled**)
- Network facilities and lag compensation
- Light / Shadows (*not sure*)
- Basic AI (*not sure*)

## Installation 

### Linux 

Make sure SFML 2 (at least) is installed. Then you can build the library and 
copy it in your path : 

```
$ cd src
$ make
$ make install
```

## Manual

FROG is based on Scenes. A Scene is composed by GameObjects that can be 
customised by adding Component. Several components are already provided, 
such as graphics, physics...
